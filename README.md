# Real-Time-AI-Customer-Support-Chatbot

Shipped: Real-Time AI Customer Support Chatbot
at Future Interns 🚀

I just wrapped up Task 3: building a smart chatbot that handles real-time customer support—from FAQs to multi-step support flows—with reliable fallbacks.

What it does

🤝 Understands intents & entities (orders, returns, refunds, payments, offers, tech issues)

🧭 Guided support flows + quick replies

🧠 “Smart fallback”: clarifies, suggests next steps, and escalates to human when needed

📊 Session logs & basic analytics (intent hit-rate, deflection, CSAT prompt)

🌐 Deployed on web + Telegram

Tech I used

NLP/LLM: OpenAI GPT, Rasa (NLU & stories)

Bot platforms: Dialogflow (rapid prototyping), Telegram Bot API

Frontend: Streamlit web widget

Data: Kaggle – Customer Support Conversations (fine-tuned intents & entities)

Infra: Webhook + lightweight DB for conversations/FAQ cache

What I learned

Designing conversation-first flows > model-first tuning

Blending rules + LLMs gives the best reliability for support

How to craft fallback/repair strategies that keep users moving

Shipping fast experiments across Dialogflow ↔ Rasa ↔ GPT and consolidating
